                <h3>Dell</h3>
                <a href="https://www.dell.com/" target="_blank">dell.com</a>

                <p>Dell's website has a ton of white space between each section, product and text.
                    It is reminiscent of Apple's look. It does work. The eye is immediately drawn to
                    the product and then over to the heading. There is also a good use of visial hierarchy.
                    They have kept it simple.

                <h3>Etsy</h3>

                <p>Etsy is all about displaying products so that you, the consumer, will purchase them.
                    So, obviously there are a lot of items to place and the most efficient and visually
                    appealing way it to place them in rows and columns that are nicely aligned. That is
                    exactly what Etsy has done here. It is clean, orderly and makes sense. Their search
                    functions work well too. They display things that you would have been looking for
                    suggested purchase.

                <h2>Contrast</h2>
                <h3>Red Cross</h3>
                <a href="https://www.redcross.org/" target="_blank">redcross.org</a>
                <img src="images/red-cross-contrast.jpg" alt="red cross web">
                <p>I love how the Red Cross used red as their contrast color. It was a bold choice
                    considering people's aversion to blood. However, it is the perfect contrasting
                    color to all of the white. It pops off the page. Your eye is drawn to it
                    immediately. They have used it sparingly. Just enough to increase its emphasis.
