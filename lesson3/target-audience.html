        <section>





            <h3>Decription</h3>
            <p>The target audience would be anyone who is living in Southeast Idaho who wants to be informed about the
                weather in order to travel, work, or
                plan anything outside of their home. Events are often dependent on weather so a list of current events
                would be helpful to citizens in order to
                be able to make plans.

                market in White Fish. <br>

            <h3>Scenarios</h3>
            <ul>
            <li> Before Taylor leaves the house for a hike, he usually hops online and checks the weather so
                he knows what to bring with him.</li>
            <li>Taylor has Monday off of work and wants to go skiing, is there enough snow?</li>
            <li>With the Covid happening, Taylor is wondering if this weedend's concert in the park is still scheduled.
            </li>
            <li>On Saturday mornings
                before the farmer's market, Christine checks the weather to make sure the events are still able to go on
                as planned.</li>
            <li>Now that the kids are virtual learning, Christine and her husband can take the kids to the lake during
                the week. What is the heat index?</li>
                </ul>
